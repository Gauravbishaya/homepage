<p>Lachit was a General under the Ahom Kings Chakradhwaj Singh and Udyadity. It was the last part of the 17th century. The Kamrup Kingdom was enjoying blissful independence under her own rule. But the Mughals of Delhi were very ambitious. They wanted to bring the whole of this sub-continent under their empire. Of course, Rana Pratap and Shivaji tried to resist this imperialistic design of the Mughal rulers. Shivaji's resistance had its effect and he stalled the further moves of the Mughals in the Western India. So, the Mughals turned their eyes towards the East and Kamrup (Assam). The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent a big army under Saiyad Sana and Saiyad Faroz to conquer Assam. The Ahom king was at a loss to decide how to face the might of the great Mughal ruler. But Lachit came forward. He organized the Ahom army and gave a crushing defeat to the Mughals. But this did not silence the Mughals. Aurangzeb sent a bigger army under Raja Ram Singh. Lachit was not sitting idle. He had already expected this attack. So, he began fortification near Pandu. When the Mughal army was almost coming to attack, Lachit came to inspect the fort. His uncle was the incharge of this fort. Lachit was shocked to find that his uncle had neglected his duty. He was sleeping soundly and the work was lying incomplete. Lachit took out his sword and killed his uncle as a traitor. He said that the country was greater than uncle. After that he worked round the clock to get the fort repaired. After that he attacked Ram Singh's army and gave them a crushing defeat. Lachit died, full of name and honour, in 1671.</p>
<br><a name="conclusion" ><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2></a><br>
<p>Lachit's life is a beautiful example of a patriotic citizen. Nothing is greater and dearer than the country and independence. We know and try to practise these in our lives. But during those days this feeling was not so strong. But there was a man in Lachit who was ahead of his time. When people were betraying their country for personal gains, Lachit made the biggest sacrifice for his country. If a man of 17th century can set such a burning example of patriotism, we can also do the same. Due to his sense of duty, responsibility, patriotism and love for independence, Lachit has become my favourite hero in Indian history.</p>
